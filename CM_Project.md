#### Objective: To determine if chromatin accessibility changes due to dox exposure.

We have performed a time course series of experiements measuring
chromating accessibility (ATACseq peaks)upon exposure to dox. These are
0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 minutes. Each time point has a replicate. The
fastq sequencing files were processed by the NF\_CORE ATACseq pipeline
v- 2.12 (<https://nf-co.re/atacseq/2.1.2/>).

We will be using the MACS2 output files from the NF\_CORE Pipeline For
example: -broad.peak -consensus.broad.peak
