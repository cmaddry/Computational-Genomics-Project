#### Objective: To determine if chromatin accessibility changes due to dox exposure.
We have performed a time course series of experiements measuring chromating accessibility
(ATACseq peaks)upon exposure to dox. These are 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 minutes.
Each time point has a replicate. The fastq sequencing files were processed by the
NF_CORE ATACseq pipeline v- 2.12 (https://nf-co.re/atacseq/2.1.2/).

We will be using the MACS2 output files from the NF_CORE Pipeline For example:
-broad.peak
-consensus.broad.peak
